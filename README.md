Inspire from Windows terminal issue [Add "open Windows terminal here" into right-click context menu #1060](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal/issues/1060). Thanks you all giants ‚ù§

Windows terminal is an excellent terminal. But it no offer a basic function which is **right click context menu**!  
Without it, I have to `cd` to my working directory everytime. It's inefficient.  

So I write this script to deal with it.

# Uninstall

# Misc
